Man: Mom on deck! Ten
Mom: Alright, grunts. Here's your pre-mission pep talk. Shoot anyone who doesn't obey hard enough.
Man: But
Mom: Stop gaining knowledge, Hubert! [The camera zooms out, revealing Professor Farnsworth to still have hair and be sitting on a crate. Two other crates read CONTENTS: MORE CRATES. Mom takes the book off Professor Farnsworth's hands and grunts as she rips it apart. The man is behind her.] It's a simple mission. The grunts catch the Alien, the surgeon guts it, and you smuggle the poison parts back here.
Professor Farnsworth: Eh, something about poison. Got it. Eh, by the way, that surgeon... Where is he?
Mom: You! Where's the butcher?!
Man: Ma'am, I dunno, ma'am. 'Is duffel bag arrived.
Zoidberg: It's not a duffel bag. It's my apartment.
Mom: Hubert, meet John Zoidberg. You need an Alien hacked to pieces, he's the best there is. In the budget category.
Professor Farnsworth: Have you ever dissected a Yeti before?
Zoidberg: Pfff. Himalayan or Neptunian?
Professor Farnsworth: Tritonian.
Zoidberg: A Tritonian Yeti?! You two aren't up to anything unethical, are you?!
Mom: Relax. There's nothing unethical about covert biological weapons research. I said, "Relax."
Professor Farnsworth: Ah, Zoidberg. We've known each other so long that... Sometimes, I don't think we even need words to understand each other.
Zoidberg: What?
Leela: Once and for all, Fry, even though it's the future, most objects are still just objects. Not Aliens who look like objects.
Fry: So my efforts to establish diplomatic relations with the cactus people were doomed from the start.
Zoidberg: So you're in pain and 'ave a bunch o' needles. I prescribe acupuncture. Let's begin. Blood?! I mean, "Blood."
Fry: Put it back in me!
Zoidberg: I'm afraid Fry lost a lotta juice. He's developed Simpsons jaundice.
Fry: Ay, caramba!
Zoidberg: His only hope is some replacement liver. Yours looks like a good match.
Leela: Well, if it'll help Fry
Fry: Careful, Leela! He knows less about Human anatomy than I do. And I can't even find my own uterus!
Zoidberg: You may feel a slight sawing!
Zoidberg: And all we need is a little spine supplement to replace what Leela lost in that unavoidable saw mix-up.
Leela: It wasn't unavoidable! You just had to stop cutting my spine when I yelled, "Stop! You're cutting my spine!"
Fry: Quit complaining! My body rejected your liver and now I've got Garfield syndrome. I hate Mondays.
Zoidberg: Anyhow, Hermes, all Leela needs is one of your vertebrae.
Hermes: But, Doctor, will I be able to limbo afterwards?
Zoidberg: Could you limbo before? Wait. I say, "Yes." And you say, "I couldn't limbo before." You ruined the joke, Hermes!
Zoidberg: There you go, Leela. Good as new!
Leela: Whoa! Whoa!
Fry: Oh, sure.
Leela: Whoa!
Fry: Leela's fine. But my jaundice has progressed a Muppet gangrene. It's not easy being gangrenous.
Hermes: I thought you were only gonna take out one vertebra!
Zoidberg: Yeah, but did you ever play Jenga? Sometimes, you pull one and
Fry: Oh, yeah? Well, I've got news for ya. I'm not stayin' like this. You're the Doctor!
Zoidberg: Hmmm. What started out as a pleasant afternoon of drugs and surgery has not gone as planned. But don't worry. We still 'ave three or four coworkers with plenty of spare parts.
Zoidberg: My first mission. I'm so excited. And, after I dissect the Yeti's poison glands, we can stop maybe for ice cream on the way back? With sprinkles on?
Professor Farnsworth: Why, you're just a big kid, aren't you, Zoidberg?
Zoidberg: A very big kid.
Man: We're over the drop zone, gentlemen. Might I suggest you jump out the door and poop yourselves.
Zoidberg: So, anyway, I hope the men 'ave been taking their hypermalaria pills.
Professor Farnsworth: Their wha?!
Zoidberg: "Their wha?!" That's funny. Like a crazy, old man. But you know what's not funny? Deadly Tritonian hypermalaria. Just be sure to stay outta the methane swamps. What smells like methane?
Doctor: My God. I've never seen such a gruesome shark attack. Especially this far inland.
Leela: It wasn't a shark. It was an awful, incompetent doctor.
Doctor: Wow. He must've been a total Zoidberg.
Hermes: It was Zoidberg! He brutalised us with power tools, gypsy curses, and hypnosis!
Amy: Yes, master.
Doctor: You'll all get through this. I give you my word as a real doctor.
Bender: What about me?
Doctor: What did 'e do to you?
Bender: I dunno exactly, but... I'm incontinent.
Doctor: I'm truly sorry.
Fry: I consider myself a reasonable man. Quick with a joke. Slow to anger. But Bender can't go on long car trips anymore an' I say Zoidberg must die!
Hermes: People, please! Let's not overreact Death to the crab!
Professor Farnsworth: How bad is it, Doctor?
Zoidberg: Super bad. It's Tritonian hypermalaria. A lot of these men will be dead within twenty-four hours.
Man: What?!
Zoidberg: Not you, though! You'll make a complete recovery and go on to marry a super model! Funny plague, hypermalaria. It can kill immediately. Or lie dormant for decades. But, sooner or later, it erupts, causing fever, spasms, madness, coma, and finally... Death.
Man: What?!
Zoidberg: Super model!
Professor Farnsworth: Oh! Those poor, doomed bastards. I guess it's up to me to complete the mission.
Professor Farnsworth: I'll be in the swamp, blowing the smirk off a toxic Yeti.
Hermes: Professor, we need to talk! Man-to-mob. You need to listen to us! Yes, you do!
Leela: We've had it with Zoidberg! We demand you fire him!
Professor Farnsworth: Nonsense! Zoidberg's a fine physician. For Aliens. Your mistake is being Humans! No. If I'm going to fire anyone, it'll be Scruffy.
Hermes: Ya can't do that!
Bender: What did Scruffy ever do to you?!
Amy: Over my dead body!
Bender: Don't you get it, old man? Thanks to Dr. Scissor Hands, I wet myself every time I laugh. It's not funny! Well... I guess it is kinda funny. Uh-oh.
Hermes: Why are you protecting Zoidberg, Professor? Do you owe him something?
Leela: Is he blackmailing you somehow?
Amy: What does 'e have on you?! Why have you kept 'im around all these years when 'e's so grossly incompetent?!
Professor Farnsworth: Long ago, Zoidberg an' I entered into a secret arrangement relating to certain extraordinary events too horrible to reveal. So there's nothing to be curious about!
Professor Farnsworth: Stop or I'll shoot! Zoidberg?!
Zoidberg: You can't hunt a Yeti by yourself, sir. It's suicidal.
Professor Farnsworth: So what?! I'm going to die of hypermalaria, anyway. I was in the same swamp as the rest of the men.
Zoidberg: Just because you were in the swamp, doesn't necessarily mean
Professor Farnsworth: I was thirsty from the flight! I drank swamp water! Look, Zoidberg. You're a loyal friend.
Zoidberg: Friend?!
Professor Farnsworth: But I'm doomed. I might as well capture a Yeti and die trying.
Zoidberg: Then you'll need someone to dissect it! Friend.
Professor Farnsworth: Go, Johnny! Go! That's an order!
Zoidberg: Never! Zoidberg doesn't abandon a friend apparently.
Professor Farnsworth: Ooh! Ooh-ho-ho!
Zoidberg: I'll save us! By scaring 'im off with my crazy war noise! Crunch all you want. I'll make more.
Zoidberg: Oy. I lost another one.
Leela: Zoidberg... I'm sorry to break it to you this way, but we hate you and we never wanna see you again.
Zoidberg: But, friends
Hermes: We're not your friends! We're your victims!
Zoidberg: I was just trying to
Amy: Shut up and give me my kidney back!
Zoidberg: I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
Fry: We dunno why the Professor keeps you around here and we don't care! You're a terrible doctor! Nobody wants to see you ever again!
Professor Farnsworth: Dr. Zoidberg, I want to see you right now!
Professor Farnsworth: The time 'as come, my friend. We have to talk about... Our arrangement.
Zoidberg: Oh, no! No! No! Oh, no, no, no! Oh, no!
Zoidberg: Oh, no!
Professor Farnsworth: Unpaw him, you big ape! I saw this in a Tarzan movie. It was called... Tarzan versus the Yetis. I lost my virginity... Ooh! During the film. So I'm... Hah! A little fuzzy on the details. Oh! John... Are you alright?
Zoidberg: You! You saved my life!
Professor Farnsworth: Oh, fuff.
Zoidberg: Yes, fuff. How can I ever repay you?! Do you need a slave? Or maybe a butler?
Professor Farnsworth: No, I haven't needed a butler since grad school. But I do need a doctor. I don't wanna die like those marines, John. The fever! The madness!
Zoidberg: Don't forget the spasms, coma, and death.
Professor Farnsworth: I don't want to go through that! I want you to kill me!
Zoidberg: Alright. Give me the knife.
Professor Farnsworth: Not now! Hypermalaria can lie dormant for years. Isn't that what you said?
Zoidberg: It sounds like something I would say.
Professor Farnsworth: So stay with me until the symptoms start. Then... Put me out of my misery. You must swear!
Zoidberg: Alright, Hubert. I swear.
Professor Farnsworth: It's started, Zoidberg. The fever. The muscle spasms. I'm dying. It's time for you to keep your promise and kill me.
Zoidberg: This is very difficult. But I'll try... Friend.
Professor Farnsworth: No! Wait! I'm afraid to die!
Zoidberg: Argh! You said you wanted me to kill you! Is this one o' those "No means yes" deals?!
Professor Farnsworth: Yes and no. I do want you to kill me. But I mustn't see it coming. That would be agony! So you must murder me completely by surprise.
Zoidberg: As God is my witness, you can count on me. Well... See you tomorrow.
Professor Farnsworth: Not surprising enough!
Professor Farnsworth: Eh, wha?! Oh! My... Heart!
Fry: Hey!
Leela: What are you doing there?
Professor Farnsworth: Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!
Zoidberg: Stop! You don't understand!
Leela: Let's go, you murderer! Fry, help me lock 'im up!
Fry: Hang on. I'm learnin' how to do loop-de-loops.
Professor Farnsworth: Whoa! Whoa! Woo!
Zoidberg: You're making a mistake! I was only trying to kill the Professor!
Bender: Ooh.
Zoidberg: Hubert... I'm sorry. Wha?! He doesn't have hair. Great Little Caesar's ghost!
Professor Farnsworth: You fools! You stupid, life-prolonging fools! I asked Zoidberg to kill me!
Amy: Huh?!
Bender: What you talkin' 'bout, Professor?!
Hermes: Professor, have you gone mad?!
Professor Farnsworth: Probably! It's one o' the symptoms of Tritonian hypermalaria!
Amy: You mean the incurable disease that causes fever... Spasms... Insanity... Coma... And finally death?!
Professor Farnsworth: Yes! And I begged Zoidberg to put me out of my misery! Bring 'im! Quickly!
Scruffy: Hmmm. Should've known better than to store my antiques in the office.
Leela: Zoidberg, we were wrong! We're letting you out so you can kill the Professor!
Zoidberg: Woop-woop-woop-woop-woop-woop-woop-woop-woop.
Amy: Oh, no! He sand-crabbed out!
Leela: Then we have no choice. We'll have to mercy-kill the Professor ourselves.
Bender: Well, let's get started.
Walt: We have a situation, Mother. This creature tried to sand-crab into the building.
Mom: Zoidberg?!
Zoidberg: Sorry I didn't call first, Carol. Uh... But I'm in a hurry! I need your help to save Hubert!
Mom: Let him go and stooge the hell out of here!
Larry: We're on it.
Walt: Ow!
Igner: Ow!
Larry: Ow!
Zoidberg: Beautiful kids. You must be very proud!
Mom: John Zoidberg... It's been a long time. How've you been?
Zoidberg: Not too bad. Last year, I took a bus trip to the Grand Canyon. Later, I'll show you the pictures.
Mom: Do you ever regret it, John? Leaving me to work for the Professor?
Zoidberg: What do you want me to say? 'E saved my life.
Mom: Oh, big deal! You could've been rich if you'd stayed. Your own lab... A full staff...
Zoidberg: But Hubert is my friend. 'E's very sick. I can cure him. But I need the thing! The thing... From Triton!
Mom: It'll cost you, John. How much are you worth now?
Zoidberg: I live in a dumpster. All I have in the world is this coupon for one free session at the tanning salon.
Mom: Oh, John. That's really all you have? Then I'll take it.
Scruffy: Okay. Murdolator's finished.
Bender: I said I'd kill 'im myself! Nobody listens to Bender!
Leela: We all have to share in the guilt. Which is why we're each going to add one drop of cyanide to the death wheel as it goes by.
Scruffy: Commence mercy-killing... In three... Two... Ayup.
Hermes: Kill-check one is go!
Leela: Yay!
Amy: Woohoo!
Fry: Kill-check two is go!
Humans: Ooh!
Woman: Wow!
Hattie: It's about time.
Female voice: Vegetables activated.
Bender: Kill-check three is go! Also, the salad's ready.
Leela: Yay, salad!
Amy: Yay!
Zoidberg: What the hell are you doing?!
Leela: Zoidberg! We know about your secret agreement. I am so, so sorry for how we treated you.
Fry: And, to make it up to you, we're killing the Professor for you so he doesn't die horribly from hypermalaria.
Zoidberg: 'E doesn't have hypermalaria, you idiots! 'E has Yetiism. When 'e saved my life all those years ago, 'e was scratched by a Yeti!
Fry: Hmmm. I consider myself almost completely ignorant of modern medicine. And I've never heard of Yetiism.
Zoidberg: It mimics the symptoms of hypermalaria exactly. Except for the part where, instead of dying, you turn into a Yeti! Wow! Hold 'im down while I prepare the antidote.
Leela: Another Yeti?!
Zoidberg: Yes. The same jerk that once noshed on me like a shrimp toast. Now, who's getting 'is pineal gland extracted? Ah, yes. This contains a concentrated form of the Yeti neurotoxin.
Hermes: But that's what gave 'im Yetiism in the first place! Won't it just make 'im a double Yeti?!
Zoidberg: Don't lecture me about Alien physiology, Conrad! The pineal neurotoxin neutralises the adrenal neurotoxin. That's why Yetis don't drive themselves mad!
Fry: My God. He's like some kinda believable Hulk!
Zoidberg: No time for an injection. Uh! I'll be damned. It did make 'im a double Yeti!
Amy: It wasn't supposed to do any of those things.
Professor Farnsworth: You did it, Johnny. I'm cured!
Bender: Wow! Alright, let's set it up and try again.
Professor Farnsworth: There's one thing I don't understand, Zoidberg. How did you persuade Mom to give you her precious Yeti head? Did you 'ave to promise anything in return?
Zoidberg: Nothing. Nothing at all.
Amy: This calls for a celebration! Come on, everyone! Let's go tanning!
Bender: Hooray!
Professor Farnsworth: Yay!
Zoidberg: I was going to tan... Once.
Professor Farnsworth: What do you say, Johnny? It's on me.
Zoidberg: Thank you, Hubert.
Professor Farnsworth and Zoidberg: Woop-woop-woop-woop-woop-woop-woop-woop-woop.
