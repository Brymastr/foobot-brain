Fry: Space. It seems to go on and on forever. But then you get to the end and the gorilla starts throwing barrels at you.
Fry: And that's how you play the game!
Boy: You stink, loser!
Panucci: Hey, Fry. Pizza goin' out! C'mon!!
Fry: Michelle, baby! Where you going?
Michelle: It's not working out, Fry. [shouting; from cab] I put your stuff out on the sidewalk!
Fry: I hate my life, I hate my life, I hate my life.
Bike Thief: Happy new year!
Fry: Hello? Pizza delivery for, uh ... ... Icy Wiener? Aw, crud! I always thought at this point in my life I'd be the one making the crank calls! Here's to another lousy millennium.
Crowd: Ten!
Crowd: Neuf!
Crowd: Otto!
Crowd: Saba!
Crowd: Eksi!
Crowd: Wu!
Crowd: Char!
Crowd: Thathu!
Crowd: Nee!
Crowd: One!
Fry: What the--?
Fry: My God! It's the future. My parents, my co-workers, my girlfriend; I'll never see any of them again. Yahoo!
Terry: Welcome to the world of tomorrow!
Lou: Why do you always have to say it that way?
Terry: Haven't you ever heard of a little thing called showmanship? Come, your destiny awaits!
Lou: Have a nice future.
Fry: Cool! Just like in Star Trek! Ow!
Leela: Good afternoon, sir. Name?
Fry: Uh, Fry.
Leela: I'm Leela. Now, it's New Year's Eve so I'd like to decide your fate quickly and get out of here.
Fry: Can I ask you a question?
Leela: As long as it's not about my eye.
Fry: Uh...
Leela: Is it about my eye?
Fry: Sort of.
Leela: Just ask the question.
Fry: What's with the eye?
Leela: I'm an alien, alright? Now let's drop the subject.
Fry: Cool, an alien! Has your race taken over the Earth?
Leela: No, I just work here.
Fry: Wait a minute! Is that blimp accurate?
Leela: Yep. It's December 31st, 2999.
Fry: My God! A million years!
Leela: I'm sure this must be very upsetting for you.
Fry: Y'know, I guess it should be but, actually, I'm glad. I had nothing to live for in my old life. I was broke, I had a humiliating job and I was beginning to suspect my girlfriend might be cheating on me.
Leela: Well, at least here you'll be treated with dignity. Now strip naked and get on the probulator.
Leela: Interesting. Your DNA test shows one living relative. He's your great-great-great-great-great-great-great...
Leela: ...great-great-great-great-great nephew.
Fry: That's great! What's the little guy's name?
Leela: Professor Hubert Farnsworth.
Fry: Eurgh!
Fry: Y'know, I'm the luckiest guy in the whole future. I've been given a second chance and this time I'm not going to be a total loser. What's that?
Leela: Your permanent career assignment.
Fry: Delivery boy? No! Not again! Please! Anything else!
Leela: Take your hands off me! You've been assigned the job you're best at just like everyone else.
Fry: What if I refuse?
Leela: Then you'll be fired--
Fry: Fine!
Leela: Out of a cannon into the Sun!
Fry: But I don't like being a delivery boy.
Leela: Well that's tough! Lots of people don't like their jobs but we do them anyway. [She points at a poster of a man wearing a hardhat with the caption "You Gotta Do What You Gotta Do".] You gotta do what you gotta do. Now hold out your hand. I'm gonna implant your career chip. It'll permanently label you as a delivery boy.
Fry: Keep that thing away from me!
Leela: Hold still, dammit. I don't have good depth perception! You've got until the count of five to let me out of here. One--
Fry: See you in a thousand years! You owe me one.
Fry: Whoa!
Man #1: JFK Jr. Airport.
Man #1: Radio City Mutant Hall.
Fry: Cool! Um. Cross Town Express?
Man #2: Pft! Tourist!
Fry: Hey! A phone booth! I can call my nephew. Wow! A real live robot! Or is that some kind of cheesy New Year's costume?
Bender: Bite my shiny metal ass.
Fry: It doesn't look so shiny to me.
Bender: Shinier than yours, meatbag!
Bender: Listen, buddy, I'm in a hurry here. Let's try for a two-fer!
Booth Voice: Please select mode of death: "Quick and Painless" or "Slow and Horrible".
Fry: Yeah, I'd like to place a collect call.
Booth Voice: You have selected: "Slow and Horrible".
Bender: Great choice! Bring it on, baby!
Bender: C'mon, c'mon! Kill me already! By the way, my name's Bender!
Fry: Help! What's happening?
Booth Voice: You are now dead. Thank you for using Stop-N-Drop, America's favourite suicide booth since 2008.
Bender: Lousy, stinking rip-off! Well, I didn't have anything else planned for today. Let's go get drunk!
Leela: Two, three-- Hey!
Terry: Welcome to the world of tomorrow!
Leela: Shut up, Terry.
Ipgee: This is unacceptable, Leela. You must find this Mr. Fry and install his chip.
Leela: Look, he's just a nobody who doesn't want to be a delivery boy. I'd really rather not force it on him.
Ipgee: Well that's your job, whether you like it or not. And it's my job to make you do your job whether I like it or not, which I do, very much! Now get to work! Life is good!
Fry: Why would a robot need to drink?
Bender: I don't need to drink, I can quit anytime I want! So they made you a delivery boy, huh? Man, that's as bad as my job.
Fry: Really? What do you do, Bender?
Bender: I'm a bender. I bend girders, that's all I'm programmed to do.
Fry: You any good at it?
Bender: You kidding? I was a star! I could bend a girder to any angle: 30 degrees, 32 degrees, you name it! 31. But I couldn't go on living once I found out what the girders were for.
Fry: What?
Bender: Suicide booths! Well, Fry, it was a pleasure meeting you. I'm gonna go kill myself.
Fry: Wait! You're the only friend I have!
Bender: You really want a robot for a friend?
Fry: Yeah, ever since I was six.
Bender: Well, OK. But I don't want people thinking we're robo-sexuals. So, if anyone asks, you're my debugger.
Fry: Oh, no, it's the Cyclops! Don't look! Don't look!
Bender: I'm not looking!
Leela: This is officer 1B-DI requesting back-up.
Smitty: We'll be there in five minutes.
Bender: We can hide in here. It's free on Tuesdays!
Nimoy: Welcome to the Head Museum. I'm Leonard Nimoy.
Fry: Spock? Hey! Hey... Do the thing!
Nimoy: I don't do that anymore.
Fry: This is unbelievable! What do you heads do all day?
Nimoy: We share our wisdom with those who seek it. It's a life of quiet dignity.
Woman: Feeding time!
Leela: Hmm. I'm sorry, Fry, but I have to install your career chip.
Fry: Yeah, well, if you're sorry why are you doing it?
Leela: It's my job. You gotta do what you gotta do! Watch it!
Nixon: That's it! You just made my list!
Fry: Ow! Stop it! Down, boy! Bad president!
Smitty: Alright, buddy, step away from the head!
URL: I'm gonna get 24th century on his ass!
Leela: Please, officers, there's no need to use force.
URL: Let us handle this, weird-y.
Leela: Oh, come on, he's just a poor kid from the Stupid Ages.
Smitty: Keep your big nose out of this, eyeball!
Leela: No-one makes fun of my nose.
URL: Damn!
Leela: You guys were totally out of control.
Smitty: It's our job. We're peace officers.
URL: Yeah, you know the law: You gotta do what you gotta do.
Bender: Oh, we're trapped!
Fry: Wait a second. You're a bender, right? We can get out of here if you just bend the bars.
Bender: Dream on, skin tube. I'm only programmed to bend for constructive purposes. What do I look like, a de-bender?
Fry: Who cares what you're programmed for. If someone programmed you to jump off a bridge would you do it?
Bender: I'll have to check my program ... yep.
Leela: Open up!
Fry: C'mon, Bender! It's up to you to make your own decisions in life. That's what separates people and robots from animals ... and animal robots.
Bender: You're full of crap, Fry! You make a persuasive argument, Fry.
Fry: Come on, Bender! You can do it.
Bender: Can't ... I ... can't ... do ... it!
Fry: Yes!
Bender: You were right, Fry! From now on I'm going to bend what I want, when I want, who I want! I'm unstoppable!
Fry: I don't know how you did that.
Leela: Wait!
Bender: No, thanks.
Bender: Looks like one of us will have to bend this grate.
Fry: Good Lord! What is this?
Bender: It's the decaying ruins of Old New York. Welcome home, pal!
Fry: It's my old neighbourhood. Man, this brings back a lot of memories.
Bender: Keep 'em to yourself, Pops!
Fry: This is where I brought my girlfriend on our very first date.
Fry: My God! She's gone. Everyone I ever knew or cared about is gone.
Bender: Wait! There's someone you know!
Fry: Oh, can't you leave me alone? I'm miserable enough already.
Leela: Look, I know it's not much consolation but I understand how you feel.
Fry: No, you don't. I've got no home, no family--
Bender: No friends.
Fry: My whole world is gone. You can't possibly understand what it feels like to be so alone.
Leela: I understand. I'm the only one-eyed alien on this whole planet. My parents abandoned me here as a baby and I don't even know what galaxy they were from. I know how it feels to be alone.
Fry: Look, Leela, I don't understand this world but you obviously do, so I give up. If you really think I should be a delivery boy, I'll do it. Your chip. What are you doing?
Leela: Quitting.
Fry: Why?
Leela: Because I've always wanted to. I just never realised it before I met you.
Fry: What is the matter with you?
Bender: I just wanted to be part of the moment.
Leela: Hey! He stole my ring!
Bender: Sorry. Well, that solves the mystery of the missing ring. This calls for a drink.
Leela: I don't wanna spoil the party but we're all job deserters now. We're unemployed and we have nowhere to go.
Fry: Correction: We're unemployed but we have a doddering old relative to mooch off of.
Clark: Hello, I'm Dick Clark's head. Welcome to a special year 3000 edition of New Year's Rockin' Eve!
Farnsworth: Who are you?
Fry: I'm your dear old Uncle Fry.
Farnsworth: I don't have an Uncle Fry.
Bender: You do now!
Farnsworth: By God, I am your nephew! This is absolutely incredible!
Bender: Can we have some money?
Farnsworth: Oh, my, no.
Farnsworth: Let me show you around. That's my lab table and this is my work-stool. And over there is my intergalactic spaceship! And here's where I keep assorted lengths of wire.
Fry: Whoa! A real live spaceship!
Farnsworth: I designed it myself. Let me show you some of the different lengths of wire I used.
Smitty: Attention, job deserters! Come out with your hands up. We have you partially surrounded.
Fry: No!
Nixon: Get those bums!
Bender: Well, we're boned!
Leela: Can't we get away in the ship?
Farnsworth: I suppose it is technically possible. Though I am already in my pyjamas.
Fry: I'll get us out of here.
Farnsworth: Can anyone drive stick?
Leela: I can. As long as I don't have to parallel park.
URL: If they try to take off, give 'em an ass-ful of laser.
Leela: Prepare for lift-off. Ten.
Crowd: Nine!
Crowd: Amania!
Crowd: Seven!
Aliens: [chanting; in alien] Six.
Terry: Five!
Nimoy: Four.
Farnsworth: Three.
Bender: Two.
Leela: One!
Fry: Blast-off!
Nixon: Fire! Fire!
Smitty: I can't see nothing. Pretty though!
Fry: So, I guess, without jobs, we'll be fugitives forever.
Farnsworth: Not necessarily. Are you three, by any chance, interested in becoming my new spaceship crew?
Bender: New crew? W-What happened to the old crew?
Farnsworth: Of those poor sons of-- But that's not important. The important thing is I need a new crew. Anyone interested?
Fry: Yes! Yes! That's exactly the job I've always wanted!
Leela: Thanks for the offer, Professor, but we don't have the proper career chips.
Farnsworth: Oh, that won't be a problem. As luck would have it, I saved the chips from my previous crew.
Fry: This is awesome! Are we gonna fly through space fighting monsters and teaching alien women to lurve?
Farnsworth: If by that you mean "transporting cargo" then yes. It's a little home business I started to fund my research.
Fry: Cool! What's my job gonna be?
Farnsworth: You will be responsible for ensuring that the cargo reaches its destination.
Fry: So, I'm gonna be a delivery boy?
Farnsworth: Exactly!
Fry: Alright! I'm a delivery boy!
