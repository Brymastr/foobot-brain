Dial L for Leela: Ken Keeler
Farnsworth: Good news, everyone! I've invented a device that allows you to operate equipment from great distances. I call it "the fing-longer". Observe. And, here we go. There!
Fry: Ooh!
Amy: Wow!
Zoidberg: Ah!
Farnsworth: Pretty long, eh?
Fry: Yeah, it's really long. But what did you just turn on with it?
Farnsworth: Oh, that's just the What-If machine I invented. You pose it a What-If question and it generates a video simulation of what would happen.
Fry: Does it really work?
Farnsworth: Of course it works! It's just not very long.
Bender: Ooh! Ooh! I wanna aks it a question! As a robot living among humans, I've never really felt accepted at parties or nude beaches. So I've always secretly wondered: What if I was 500-feet tall?
Zoidberg: Let's watch, shall we?
Bender: My work here is done!
Fry: I'm so lonely since I came to the future. Will you be my friend? Ow! Who are you?
Bender: I'm a big robot and I want a big cereal!
Fry: You too? Will you be my friend?
Bender: Put it there, pal! I meant your wallet.
Bender: Oh, yeah! That calms the shakes. Hey! Aw, quit it! Come on!
Fry: Stop! The robot's not your enemy! He's just a poor, misunderstood--
Zapp: Uh--
Amy: Well, there goes the neighbourhood. There goes another neighbourhood.
Hermes: We're jerked! Nothing can stop a monster that big.
Farnsworth: Nothing except and even equally big monster. This is chance to try out my experimental enlarging ray. But we'll need a guinea pig.
Zoidberg: What's this? Two meals in one week?
Farnsworth: Gotcha!
Hermes: Oh, yes!
Zoidberg: Friends! Help! A guinea pig tricked me! What?
Zoidberg: So, now Zoidberg is big, huh? That's more like it! Who's intimidating who now, big city? Hello, Mr. Chase Manhattan Bank. Deny my credit card application, will you? Ah, the famed Apollo Theater. "Boo" me off stage on open-mic night, huh? I'll show you!
Bender: Hey, I called this city! Quit touching my stuff!
Zoidberg: Tell it to claw.
Bender: Bite my colossal metal ass!
Zoidberg: Stop!
Bender: Who wants lobster bisque?
Zoidberg: Hmm?
Fry: Hey, Bender?
Bender: Huh?
Fry: Wanna make Shrinky Dinks?
Bender: Who put this in here?
Fry: Nooo! Are you people satisfied? This gentle visitor is dying! And we'll never even know why he came.
Bender: I'll tell you ... with my final breath. I came here with a simple dream: A dream of killing all humans. And this is how it must end? Who's the real 7-billion-ton robot monster here? Not I. Not I.
Fry: Goodnight, sweet prince.
Narrator: Interesting stuff. Stay tuned for more Tales of Interest!
Farnsworth: Well, Leela, care to give the What-If machine a whirl?
Leela: Maybe later. I-I mean, I don't know what to ask about.
Hermes: Come on, woman! Just pick something.
Fry: Yeah, be more impulsive. Like this.
Bender: Go, man! Go!
Leela: I can be really impulsive. It just takes me a while. Alright, Professor! Let's do it. Make that machine show me what would happen if I was a little more impulsive. Just a little. Not too much.
Leela: Hey, you guys, look what I bought on a wild impulse: New boots. They're like my old ones but with a crazy green stripe. Woo! Never know what I'm gonna do next!
Farnsworth: Leela, could you come in here for a moment. I have something important to tell you.
Farnsworth: I can't live forever and I need an heir. Someone to spend my vast riches and take care of my man-eating anteaters when I'm gone. The others simply aren't level-headed enough. They're too impulsive. Not like you. Not like old, predictable, dull-as-dishwater Leela.
Leela: Hello? New boots!
Farnsworth: That's why I've made you my sole heir. The day I die, you'll be a very wealthy woman. Oh, my, yes. Incredibly wealthy. The day I die. Because you're so unimpulsive.
Leela: Yah!
Farnsworth: Ooh! Oh, you've killed me! You've killed me!
Leela: Oh, God! What have I done?
Farnsworth: I just told you, you've killed me!
Leela: OK, just try to be nonchalant.
Zoidberg: Alright, so you're nonchalant. Quit rubbing our noses in it.
Hermes: Sweet giant anteater of Saint Anita! The Professor's been eaten by giant anteaters!
Zoidberg: What?
Hermes: If y'ask me, it's mighty suspicious! I'm gonna call the police ... right after I flush some things.
Zoidberg: Police? Bah! Nosy meddlers! It so happens I have mail order degrees in Murderology and Murderonomy. Zoidberg is afoot!
Hermes: Perhaps the Professor's files can clear things up. "Citation for public nudity", "Conspiracy to commit public nudity". Aha! A new will! Naming ... ... you as his sole heir.
Leela: That doesn't prove I killed him.
Hermes: It's a video will. It shows you killing him.
Leela: Hi-yah!
Zoidberg: Alright, anteater number one, who are you protecting? Is it anteater number two? Don't stick your tongue out at me. I need a name! What? How do you spell that?
Hermes: [shouting; from meeting room] What are you hacking off? Is it my torso? It is! My precious torso!
Zoidberg: Hermes, quiet! I'm deducing things.
Bender: Whattya got? Disposal trouble?
Leela: No! Everything's just--
Bender: Sure is shocking about the Professor, huh?. And now Hermes is mysteriously missing. Anyhow, it doesn't affect me, Bender. Hey, what's this? Hermes' dreadlocks? And his arm? Leela, I'm shocked. Food goes in the disposal, hair and flesh go in the trash!
Leela: I'm sorry, I couldn't stop-- W-Wait. Don't you care that I murdered Hermes?
Bender: Not even a little. There's nothing wrong with murder, just so long as you let Bender wet his beak.
Leela: You're blackmailing me?
Bender: "Blackmail" is such an ugly word. I prefer "extortion". The "X" makes it sound cool. Please, honey, I'm made of metal. Like you're really gonna hurt me with a-- Hey! What are you doing with that microwave?
Leela: OK, that's it. No more killing! Next time you feel like killing just have a stick of gum. Now to dispose of the body.
Amy: Wow! Sporty go-cart, Leela! So hip and sexy. Not like you at all.
Leela: Do you have any gum?
Amy: No.
Zoidberg: Ah, the gang's all here.
Leela: Who are you?
Scruffy: Scruffy, the janitor.
Leela: I've never seen you before.
Scruffy: I've never seen you before neither.
Zoidberg: Quiet, please. I've called you all here to the parlour to watch as I gradually solve the crime. One of the people in this room ... is a big murderer! You see, the killer left one fatal clue: This boot print on the Professor's lab coat.
Leela: Uh, couldn't be me. I never wear boots. See?
Fry: Ew! What smells like boot feet?
Cubert: This is preposterous. Obviously, the murderer is--
Zoidberg: My next clue came at 4.15, when the clock stopped. And another came two hours later at 4.15, when I discovered the murdered body of Amy's dead, deceased corpse.
Scruffy: Scruffy knows who killed them people. In Scruffy's opinion, it were--
Zoidberg: So, it's just as I suspected all along. The crime is unsolvable! A letter from Bender, my good friend. Dear Dr. Jerkberg, if you're reading this, I'm already dead. The person who killed me was ... was-- My God! It can't be! The murderer, it was--
Fry: I'm bored. You're boring, Zoidberg. I'm gonna go watch TV.
Leela: Could you get the lights on your way out?
Fry: Whatcha eating?
Leela: Lobster. Want some?
Fry: Sure. Y'know, I think I finally figured out what's behind all these mysterious deaths.
Leela: Really?
Fry: Was Planet Express built on an Indian graveyard?
Leela: No.
Fry: No?
Leela: No!
Fry: Then ... then ... it was you!
Leela: I don't know what came over me. I killed one person on impulse. Then I had to kill another. And another.
Fry: Well, that covers the first three killings.
Leela: And now, to make sure you won't talk, I'm gonna have to do something really impulsive!
Leela: So, Fry, what do you think of the impulsive new me?
Fry: I like it!
Leela: Good. Now let me just get the lights.
Fry: I really like it!
Farnsworth: Who else has a question for the What-If machine? Scruffy? Fry?
Fry: Um, I have a question. What if Bender was really giant?
Leela: You idiot! We already saw that.
Fry: I know. I liked it. I wanna see it again.
Farnsworth: We're not seeing it again! Ask something less stupid.
Fry: Oh, alright. How 'bout this? What if I never fell into that freezer-doodle and came to the future-jiggy?
Farnsworth: That question is less stupid, though you asked it in a profoundly stupid way. What would happen if Fry never came to the future?
Fry: Hello? Pizza delivery for ... Icy Wiener? Aw, crud! Here's to another lousy Millennium! Ow! I should have left you floating in the toilet!
Leela: What is it?
Farnsworth: It appears that the very fabric of space-time has ripped.
Bender: Hey, look! An ugly scared guy! Boo!
Fry: Who are you monsters? Is one of you Icy Wiener?
Zoidberg: If that's his pizza, then I'm icy whatever!
Fry: You believe me about the monsters, right, Mr. Panucci?
Panucci: There's only three real monsters, kid: Dracula, Blacula and Son of Kong. Now quit picking your nose and knead that dough! Hey! The usual, Professor Hawking?
Stephen Hawking: No. Today I'd like something good.
Panucci: Hawking, you're alright! I'll make you the usual!
Fry: Hey! Stephen Hawking! Aren't you that physicist that invented gravity?
Hawking: Sure. Why not?
Fry: Let me ask you something: Has anyone ever discovered a hole in nothing with monsters in it? 'Cause if I'm the first, I want them to call it "a Fry Hole".
Hawking: There is nothing to be concerned about. I must go. There is much to do.
Panucci: Hey, Hawking! Your pizza's ready.
Hawking: Toss it in the garbage!
Hawking: There he is. Seize him.
Fry: Who said that? Hey! What the--? Ooh! Ow! Ow!
Fry: Who are you people?
Gore: I'm Al Gore, and these are my Vice Presidential Action Rangers; a group of top nerds whose sole duty it is to prevent disruptions in the space-time continuum.
Fry: I thought your duty was to cast the tie-breaking vote in the Senate.
Gore: That, and protect the space-time continuum. Read the Constitution!
Fry: Hmm. So I guess you'll wanna see my Fry Hole.
Gore: Very much so. But first, meet the Action Rangers. You already know Stephen Hawking. Also with us are Nichelle Nichols, a.k.a. Commander Uhura.
Nichols: Incoming transmission from MCI "One Rate" department. It sounds like a limited-time offer.
Gore: Tell them I'm in the tub! To my left you'll recognise Gary Gygax, inventor of Dungeons & Dragons.
Gygax: Greetings! It's a ... ... pleasure to meet you!
Gore: And our summer intern, Deep Blue, the world's foremost chess-playing computer.
Deep Blue: Bishop to knight 4.
Gore: Not all missions can be solved with chess, Deep Blue. Someday you'll understand that.
Fry: Where am I, anyway?
Nichols: You're travelling in a specially-equipped terrestrial transport module.
Gygax: A school bus!
Fry: So what do you nerds want?
Nichols: It's about that rip in space-time that you saw.
Hawking: I call it a "Hawking Hole".
Fry: No fair! I saw it first!
Hawking: Who is The Journal of Quantum Physics going to believe?
Gygax: Mr. Fry, the time disruption indicates that some of that was supposed to happen but didn't, due to a quantum fluctuation.
Nichols: That's why we had to beat you with tennis rackets.
Gore: If we don't go back there and make the event happen, the entire universe will be destroyed! And as an environmentalist, I'm against that.
Fry: So then my chair tilted back and I almost fell into this freezer thingy.
Hawking: I call it a "Hawking Chamber".
Fry: But instead of falling in and getting frozen, I missed and wanged my head.
Gore: Well it's obvious what should have happened: That wang to the head should have killed you.
Fry: Uh, what?
Nichols: Let's finish the job.
Gore: No! Wait! There must be a peaceful--
Hawking: Hold him down.
Deep Blue: Check.
Fry: Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow!
Nichols: Something's wrong. Murder isn't working and that's all we're good at.
Gygax: Let's try something else. Maybe we should--
Gore: Put the dice away before I take them away.
Nichols: Wait. I'm getting an idea. What if Fry was supposed to get frozen?
Hawking: Yes. Shove him in the tube. It was my idea.
Bender: Hey, there he is again. And he brought nerds! Take this!
Gore: Get in the tube, dummy! We only have a few seconds before the universe is destroyed.
Fry: Alright. But I need a weapon to fight off drunken robots when I wake up.
Gygax: Here. Take my plus-one mace.
Fry: OK, here I go.
Gore: You fool! You foolish fool!
Fry: Eh, what's the worst thing that can happen?
Hawking: Great. The entire universe was destroyed.
Fry: Destroyed? Then where are we now?
Gore: I don't know. But I can darn well tell you where we're not: The universe.
Nichols: Eternity with nerds. It's the Pasadena Star Trek convention all over again.
Gygax: Anyone wanna play Dungeons & Dragons for the next quadrillion years?
Fry: Sure.
Hawking: I guess.
Deep Blue: Pawn to rook 8.
Gore: I'm a 10th-level Vice President!
Farnsworth: That story was preposterous. Stephen Hawking in a pizzeria! This thing isn't worth the gold it's made of. Anyway, the fing-longer seems to be arousing success.
Fry: Good work.
Leela: Congratulations!
Amy: Right on, Professor!
Farnsworth: So that's what things would be like if I'd invented the fing-longer. A man can dream though. A man can dream.
