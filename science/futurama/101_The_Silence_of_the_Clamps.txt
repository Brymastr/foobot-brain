Professor Farnsworth: Who likes good news? Everyone. Then good news, everyone! Our next delivery isn't to some dangerous, outer-space planet. It's to Earth!
Fry: Earth is dangerous. I fell off my chair there once. Ow! Quit it, Earth.
Leela: We won't even have to leave New New York! The package is going to Long Long Island.
Professor Farnsworth: Yes, to the lavish Mafia-style villa of the Donbot.
Bender: The Donbot?! The vicious Robot gangster?! I'd better use my special Robot vision to see what's inside. It looks like a pair of clamps!
Clamps: When are those new clamps gonna get here? These are all rusted-out with snitch juice!
Donbot: Patience, Clamps. It is my eldest daughter's wedding day. You don't want the Space Pope to see a clampin' now, do ya?
Clamps: Aw, jeez. I forgot my Pope manners.
Space Pope: Dearly beloved, it is with great speed that I now pronounce you husband and wife.
Donbot: What the
Joey Mousepad: May I help you with some assistance?
Leela: Delivery for... Francis X. Clampazzo?
Joey Mousepad: We don't got nobody here by that alias.
Clamps: Hey! Hey! That's me. Are those my new clamps?
Joey Mousepad: Your name's Francis?
Bender: Guys, look. It's Calculon. And the Robot Devil! And an open bar! What's not to sneak into?
Leela: Bender, you can't crash a mob wedding.
Bender: You forget, Leela, I'm Bender, owner of disguise.
Space Pope: And now, ladies and gentlemen, my good friend... Calculon!
Calculon: Hey, this one's for the new couple. It's your day. It's all about you. Who's that singing at your wedding? It's Calculon! Calculon! Calculon!
Bender: Ay! Oh! Piscopo! This guy! Bada-boing! Hey, sexy. I'm Bender. What brings you to this tacky soire?
Donbot's eldest daughter: I'm the bride!
Bender: Oops. How 'bout you, baby? Wanna do it?
Fanny: Bender, it's me, Fanny!
Bender: You who?
Fanny: The Donbot's wife? We had an affair?
Bender: An affair, huh? Sounds like me. Jeez, I'd better be a little more careful. I don't wanna hit on anybody I already had sex with.
Fanny: Hiya, Bella!
Bella: Hi, Mom!
Bender: What about you? You're my third choice.
Bella: Oh, Bender! This is all happening too slowly. Let's get married!
Bender: Quiet! I'm makin' out with a floozy! Hold your clapper. Someone's comin'!
Calculon: Donbot, please. I'll pay you back as soon as you lend me some more money.
Donbot: Sorry, Calculon. It gives me no joy to do this... Because Clamps will be doin' it. Clamps, here are your new clamps.
Clamps: Clamps!
Calculon: No. No! Line? No!
Bella: Yeah, Daddy hates welchers. The only thing he hates worse is witnesses... And guys who mess around with his daughters...
Bella: And attempt to duplicate his meatball recipe.
Leela: How was the wedding, Bender?
Bender: Says who?! I didn't witness anything!
Morbo: In entertainment news, two-time Oscar-pool winner Calculon was brutally clamped yesterday by an unknown assailant.
Amy: Poor Calculon.
Bender: Alright, Amy, you win! The mob did it. I saw the whole thing while also having hot sex with the Donbot's daughter. I'm scared and great at sex!
Leela: Bender, you need to go to the police and tell them a tastefully edited version of what you just said.
Bender: What, and have the Mafia come after me too?! No way! This secret goes to my grave!
Male voice: The Bureau is offering anyone with information about this gangland-style clamping a fifty-dollar reward.
Bender: Ooh! Ooh! Ooh! And And then Calculon said, "No. No!"
Bender: "No!" And, then, I ate some excellent meatballs. Can I have my fifty bucks now?
Robot Stack: I enjoyed your story. Especially the tasteful love scene. But it's not enough to convict the Donbot. You'll have to testify... In open court.
Bender: No. No! Can I have another fifty dollars?
Robot Stack: No.
Bender: No?
Robot Stack: No!
Bender: No!
Bailiff: All rise for the honourable Judge 723.
Judge 723: Be seated. Organised crime is a plague on our society and I will not tolerate any form of intimidation during
Bailiff: All rise for the honourable Judge 724.
Judge 724: Good day. I'd like to say I'm prepared to tolerate several, if not all, forms of intimidation during this trial. Prosecutor?
Hyper-Chicken: Your Honour, the prosecution pecks for a mistrial on the grounds of jury tamperin'!
Judge 724: Donbot?
Donbot: Motion denied.
Judge 724: Prosecutor, call your first witness.
Hyper-Chicken: The people call our star witness Mr. X, whose appearance will be altered because he's in grave danger.
Bella: Bender, I've been looking for you! Which cake do you like better for our wedding?!
Donbot: Bender?
Bender: Fix it! Fix it! Fix it! Fix it! That was close.
Yellow and red manbot: Isn't it true, Mr. X, that you were slandering this innocent Mafioso to distract from your own felonious past? Including the crime you made up yourself called burglarcenarsony?
Bender: That's a wholly-owned trademark of Rodrguez Crime Concepts Inc.! Besides, I'm not on trial here!
Judge 724: That's true. You're on trial in courtroom three.
Judge 802: You are charged with two counts of burglarcenarsony. How do you plead?
Bender: Not inno-guilty-cent!
Bender: And then the Donbot said, "Sorry, Calculon."
Bender: And then Calculon said, "No!"
Donbot: I think we've heard enough.
Bender: Wait, I'm not finished. Oh! Now I'm finished.
Hyper-Chicken: Your Honour, the prosecution roosts.
Judge 724: Have you reached a verdict?
Hedonism Bot: Indeed. After a steamy twelve-way deliberation, we find the accused guilty as
Calculon: Wait! The Donbot is innocent!
Judge 724: Calculon, who is that escorting you?
Hedonism Bot: Yes. Who?
Calculon: My personal trainer. And he's trained me to say that my wounds were self-inflicted. For, you see, I'm a big Hollywood idiot dumb guy what does that sorta thing.
Joey Mousepad: Perfect.
Hedonism Bot: We find the Donbot...
Calculon: Dramatic pause...
Hedonism Bot: Not guilty!
Amy: What?
Donbot: Honey, if you're marryin' Bender, ya might wanna get a black dress for the wedding.
Bella: That's gonna look hot!
Robot Stack: Don't be scared, Bender. We're putting you in the witness relocation programme. You'll be given a new identity, a new place to live, and this iPod. I don't want it anymore.
Bender: So I gotta hide forever?!
Robot Stack: No. Just until the Robot Mafia finds and kills you. They're pretty good at that.
Bender: Goodbye, Professor. Before I leave, I just want you to know I've never done any work whatsoever. Zoidberg, I know it seems like I can't stand you. Leela, you'll have to watch out for Fry now.
Leela: Oh, Lord.
Fry: I wish I could go with you, pal.
Bender: Me too. I'll need a butler.
Robot Stack: Bender, we have to go.
Professor Farnsworth: There'll never be another like him. Let's hire someone better!
Donbot: Clamps. Clamps!
Clamps: Huh?
Donbot: Listen to my boss words. I would like you to apply for Bender's old job and cosy up to this Fry, his best friend.
Clamps: Yeah. And I'll introduce 'im to my best friend. Clamp number one! Sorry, toots.
Donbot: No, Clamps. No clamps. Sooner or later, Bender will contact Fry... As relocated squealers always do.
Joey Mousepad: Then with the clamps... Francis.
Clamps: Francis? Francis?! I'll clamp you with the Francis!
Joey Mousepad: Ay! Oh! Take it ease.
Clamps: Hey there, Slick. I'm 'ere about the job.
Hermes: Take a seat. We'll begin the interview shortly.
Hermes: We'll start with Andrew.
Clamps: Yeah, they all kinda broke. So... When do I start?
Hermes: Everyone, this is Francis.
Fry: Hey, Francis.
Professor Farnsworth: Hello, Francis.
Leela: Hello.
Amy: Cute name.
Hermes: Look what he can do.
Clamps: Yeah, I do it all. Clampin', crimpin', occasional snippin'.
Professor Farnsworth: Snipping? Looks like you may be out of a job, Zoidberg.
Zoidberg: That's all good fun. But, of course, a clamp is no substitute for the precision of a genuine
Amy: Francis, would you do the honours?
Zoidberg: Stay off my turf!
Clamps: Eesh. That guy can bite my shiny metal clamps.
Fry: You remind me of my old friend Bender.
Clamps: Oh, yeah? Where does he safely live?
Fry: I dunno. Hey, you wanna come to my house and play?
Clamps: Yeah. Sounds like freakin' fun.
Clamps: Four stinkin' years of clampin' school for this?
Zoidberg: Greetings, Francis. Sorry if I was a little hostile before, but snipping is the only reason I'm even tolerated around here. Not like you, with those magnificent squeezers!
Clamps: Squeezers? Squeezers?! They're clamps, you ! And if I wanna -in' snip with these clamps, I will snip with these -ing clamps! Why do you think they call me Francis?
Professor Farnsworth: Eh, Francis, I have good news. It's time for your first delivery... To the Moon!
Clamps: Fan--in'-tastic!
Fry: Here's the two-hundred feet of rope you ordered, Sheriff Burley.
Sheriff Burley: Hot diggety! You fellas wanna stick around for the hangin' tomorrow? It's gonna be a doozy. I sure do love hangin' people. Well, best start cuttin' the nooses.
Leela: Oh! You know who could help with that?! Francis!
Leela: Nice job, Francis! I liked how you didn't get drunk and steal anyone's organs. Like our old Robot
Fry: Bender?! Bender! It's me, Fry!
Donbot: I knew Bender would turn up purely by coincidence. Take care of 'im, but do it quietly.
Clamps: Don't worry. We're in space. Where no one can hear you clamp!
Hermes: What do you know? The Feds gave Bender a new identity as a Moon farmer.
Fry: Well, he must be afraid to break character in case there's any Robot Mafia scuzzballs around.
Clamps: Huh?
Amy: Come on! Let's go check on 'im!
Clamps: I checked on a guy once. I checked 'im into tiny pieces!
Hydroponic farmer: Bender?! Nope, don't recollect nobody by that name. But let me ask my son-in-law. Billy!
Bender: Yes, Moon pa?
Hydroponic farmer: These nice, big-city hillbillies are lookin' for someone named Bender. You know 'im?
Bender: No, he ain't any of the eight people I ever met.
Fry: Bender, it's us, your friends. You can drop the hillbilling moron act.
Bender: Sorry, mister, but I'm no Bender. I'm just a simple farmer. Name's Billy West!
Fry: Billy West. What a stupid, phony, made-up name!
Hydroponic farmer: You city folk are probably hungry from premarital sex and flag burnin'. Y'all wanna stay for supper?
Amy: Well... My boyfriend and I were gonna have sex on a burning flag, but... I could have a bite.
Billy West: May I present my beautiful Robot wife, the Crushinator. She's servin' up the dinner and the charm.
Crushinator: Mashed chicken, Mr. Fry?
Fry: Sure!
Clamps: So, uh... Billy... Where were you born?
Billy West: Right here in Moon country!
Professor Farnsworth: And how long have you been a farmer?
Billy West: Reckon I was born a farmer. Folks say my momma was a hoe.
Leela: Oh, dear! I seem to have warped my fork! Could you bend it back for me? Billy?
Billy West: Bend it? I can't even lift it. Which is weird... Seein' as how my daddy was a forklift.
Leela: Wow! Bender is really committed to his new Jethrovian identity!
Billy West: If y'all are all finished, I'll drive y'all back to town in the old clunker.
Billy West: So... Y'all flew here in a spacey-ship?
Hermes: Stop talking like that! You live on the Moon!
Fry: If that is Bender, I guess he's just happier in his new life.
Professor Farnsworth: I refuse to believe anyone is happy! Mr. West, would you mind if I examined your brain?
Billy West: Examine? Heck. If you can find it, you can keep it.
Professor Farnsworth: Gadzooks! Bender's hard drive no longer contains any of his old memories. When the Feds bumpkinised him, they completely wiped out his old identity!
Billy West: Well, I don't know about that. But who am I to argue with a man from the sky! So long, space heroes!
Fry: You sure you don't wanna kill all Humans?
Billy West: Pfff! I love all Humans!
Fry: He really is gone.
Fry: I guess I'm happy for 'im. And, honestly, Francis is a way better friend than Bender ever was. Hey, where is Francis?
Billy West: One sasparoil, Sheriff! I'm thirsty!
Sheriff Burley: Make it two. I'm greedy.
Clamps: You got the rest fooled. But not me. Now let's take this outside so's no one else gets clamped.
Billy West: You're the boss, stranger!
Clamps: I'm gonna clamp your body parts off one by one. But, then, I'm gonna clamp your wounds shut so ya stay alive... While I clamp ya some more. Say your prayers, stoolie.
Billy West: Okay! God bless grandma and grandpa
Clamps: They're next! Right now, I'm gonna cut your damn head off!
Zoidberg: Drop the Robut. I thought I told you. I do the cutting around here.
Clamps: Scuttle on home. This ain't none of your business, Slick.
Zoidberg: My name isn't Slick. It's Zoidberg. John -ing Zoidberg!
Fry: Stop, Zoidberg! You'll hurt Francis!
Clamps: Oh, yeah? Take this! That that!
Zoidberg: Oy!
Clamps: Why, you lousy I'm gonna clamp ya!
Zoidberg: Oy! Ow. Ow. Ow.
Clamps: Looks like an all-you-can-kill lobster fest.
Zoidberg: That offer was for a limited time only.
Clamps: My clamps!
Fry: Why, Zoidberg?! Why?!
Zoidberg: Because our friend Francis here is in reality... A bad murderer.
Billy West: Yup. He was fixin' to kill me. This here crawdad done saved my life!
Bella: Bender, you two-timing jerk! I put off my singing career for you! And, if I can't have you, no one can!
Billy West: Aw, shucks.
Fry: Bender!
Leela: No!
Hermes: What?
Donbot: Bender was a helluva squealer. Maybe the best there ever was. We'll send his widow some meatballs. Clamps, Bella, get in the way-back.
Fry: To my friend Bender. A wise man once said he was a helluva squealer. Maybe the best there ever was.
All: To Bender!
Bender: You pizzas gonna be another minute. We are still waitin' for it to be delivered.
Fry: Bender?!
Bender: I'm no Bender. You got me mixed up with another Robot.
Fry: You're probably right. I don't really remember what he looks like.
Bender: Guys! Guys! It's me, Bender!
Fry: He's alive!
Leela: So that Moon hillbilly who got murdered was just an innocent husband and father!
Professor Farnsworth: Bender, old bot, the Mafia thinks you're dead! You can come back to work with us!
Bender: I'm back, baby!
Brown-haired man: Pizza's here.
Bender: Woo! I'll just cut that.
Zoidberg: You do and I'll -ing gut you like a fish!
