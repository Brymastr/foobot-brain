Announcer: Ladies and gentlemen, Conan O'Brien's head.
O'Brien: Thank you, thank you. Let's get started. Max, play me over. Looks like someone forgot to feed Max. So, people are getting pretty worried about this Y2K problem, huh?
Bender: No, they fixed that 900 years ago.
O'Brien: Just bear with me, sir. Anyway, I'm walking to work this morning--
Bender: I doubt it!
O'Brien: Listen, pal, I may have lost my freakishly long legs in the war of 2012 but I've still got something you'll never have: A soul!
Bender: Eh.
O'Brien: And freckles! Well, I'm out of material. You can catch me next week at the Andromeda Chuckle Hut. Enjoy your breakfast.
Bender: Ah, let's face it: Comedy's a dead art form. Now, tragedy... That's funny!
Farnsworth: Come on, everyone. Perhaps some skiing will help us forget the mouldy old antics of Conan O'Brien.
Amy: Yeah!
Leela: Great idea!
Zoidberg: We can only hope!
Fry: This snow is beautiful. I'm glad global warming never happened.
Leela: Actually it did. But thank God nuclear winter cancelled it out.
Fry: Hi!
Bender: Enough of your mindless chitchat, let's get going.
Hermes: Jah damnit! We're stuck.
Zoidberg: At least you're not cold-blooded!
Hermes: Sweet lion of Zion! Look at the Professor go.
Fry: Look out! We're heading straight for those trees!
Leela: Yeah, yeah, relax. Trees down.
Trees: Trees down.
Fry: Cool. Hey, what do you do if you want the trees up?
Trees: Trees up.
Fry: Trees down!
Trees: Trees down.
Bender: Lookin' good, meatball!
Man #1: Excuse me, sir, you're snowboarding off the trail.
Bender: Lick my frozen, metal ass. Uh-oh!
Child: Mommy!
Zoidberg: You, a bobsledder? That I'd like to see!
Hermes: Listen, you filthy crab, a thousand years ago there was a legendary team of Jamaican bobsledders.
Fry: Yup, I remember. They came in last at the Olympics then retired to promote alcoholic beverages.
Hermes: A true inspiration for the children. Um, a little help please? Nooo!
Fry: Oh, what the hell! Ow!
Amy: You poor man. What happened to you?
Man #2: Well, there I was on the triple diamond slope, when suddenly--
Amy: Oh, excuse me. Hello, there!
Farnsworth: Wha?
Bender: Ah! Nothing like a warm fire and a Super Soaker of fine cognac.
Fry: Yeah, it really puts you in the Christmas spirit.
Farnsworth: What-mas?
Fry: Christmas. You know? X-M-A-S.
Leela: Oh, you mean Xmas. You must be using an archaic pronunciation. Like when you say "ask" instead of "aks".
Fry: Xmas, huh? Y'know, this'll be my first Xmas away from home.
Leela: Hey, hey. Let me aks you something: Would it cheer you up if we went and cut down an Xmas tree?
Fry: Yeah! An old-fashioned Xmas tree!
Fry: Hey! These aren't Xmas trees!
Farnsworth: Eh, wha?
Fry: They're supposed to be some kinda, you know, pine tree.
Farnsworth: Pine trees have been extinct for 800 years, Fry. Gone the way of the poodle and your primitive notions of modesty. Ah! Brisk!
Fry: This isn't the way Christmas is supposed to be.
Farnsworth: There, there.
Fry: Everything's changed.
Leela: That's not true.
Bender: : Xmas tree, oh, Xmas tree! Bah-boo-bee-boo-bah-bee-boh.
Amy: Ow!
Fry: Every Christmas my mom would get a fresh goose for goose burgers and my dad would whip up his special eggnog out of bourbon and ice cubes. This dumb holiday just makes me think of all the things I left behind. Let's just stop talking about Xmas.
Hermes: Happy Xmas, Xmas people! Xmas cards have arrived! Xmas! Amy, there you go. Fry, Professor, Zoidberg, a mighty haul for Bender.
Bender: Yes! I got the most! I win Xmas!
Hermes: And last, but not least, the sweet flower of the office: Me. Hermes Conrad.
Bender: Hmm. [He opens the card. The message reads "Merry Xmas Son #1729". With it is a photo of a robotic arm.] Ah, a picture of my mommy.
Zoidberg: Huh? What's this? A card from my cousin Zoidfarb. [The message reads "Santa "Claws" Cousin Zoidfarb". Zoidberg chuckles.] Instead of "Claus" he writes "Claws"! Now that's humorous. Today's comedians could learn from this card.
Fry: What's the point of Xmas when everyone you know died a thousand years ago? I'm the loneliest person on Earth. Hey, Leela, how 'bout a little sympathy here, huh? Yoiks! What was that about?
Amy: Fluh! She's an orphan.
Farnsworth: Yes, and the only one of her species in all the known universe. What a lonely life.
Fry: My God! Poor Leela.
Bender: Hey, buddy, heard you needed cheering up! Well, old Bender'll make you laugh. Look at me, look! Oh, man, I gotta work on my act!
Fry: I feel like a rat. Here I am whining like a pig while all along Leela was lonely as a frog. I could kick myself.
Amy: I'll do it for you.
Fry: Ow! Thanks.
Farnsworth: You should be ashamed of yourself, Fry. You'd have to be blind not to notice that Leela's a cyclops.
Hermes: Fry's over there, man.
Farnsworth: Oh?
Bender: Xmas Eve; another pointless day where I accomplish nothing.
Linda: The holiday season is a time of celebration for most. But it is also a time to remember the tragic suffering of the less fortunate.
Morbo: Earthlings do not yet know the meaning of suffering.
Linda: Earlier today I visited a shelter for down-and-out robots. Homeless robots, too poor to afford even the basic alcohol they need to fuel their circuits. Is there anything sadder? Only drowning puppies. And there would have to be a lot of them.
Amy: Where are you going, Bender?
Bender: To volunteer at a liquor kitchen for homeless robots.
Hermes: Yeah, right! As if you ever did anything charitable.
Bender: I'm very generous. What about that time I gave blood?
Fry: Whose blood?
Bender: Some guy's.
Fry: I've got to do something to show Leela how sorry I am.
Zoidberg: So what's the problem? Just get down on your claws and do the apology dance.
Fry: So it's left, left, right-- Wait! I have a better idea! I'll go out and get her the perfect Xmas present. Something so great she'll never want to be unhappy again.
Hermes: Just be back by sundown, mon.
Fry: We'll see. I like to haggle.
Amy: You can't stay out on Xmas Eve. You'll be killed!
Fry: Say what?
Farnsworth: Good Lord! He doesn't know about Santa Claus.
Fry: I know about Santa Claus.
Farnsworth: Back in 2801, the Friendly Robot Company built a robotic Santa to determine who'd be naughty and who'd been nice and distribute presents accordingly. But something went wrong.
Fry: Wow! 2801! Anyway...
Farnsworth: Wait, you fool! Due to a programming error, Santa's standards were set too high and he invariably judges everyone to be naughty.
Amy: If he catches you after dark, he'll chop off your head and stuff your neck full of toys from his sack of horrors.
Farnsworth: Nice meeting you.
Preacherbot: Welcome, brother! May the blessings of the season be upon you.
Bender: Yeah, yeah, amen. Listen, I'm one of those lazy homeless bums I've been hearing about. Could you point me to the free booze. Oh, yeah! Oh, yeah!
Fry: There's this girl who I really like but she thinks I'm a jerk. Can you help me?
Salesman #1: Yeah, there's a suicide booth in the food court. Though there's a line this time of year.
Fry: No, I need to get her a gift. And I need it before sundown.
Salesman #1: Well, you can't go wrong with something traditional. A Surface-to-Santa rocket launcher. It comes with three jolly-seeking missiles.
Fry: That's funny!
Salesman #1: Careful, sir!
Bender: Oh, yeah! You filthy hobos sure know how to live. Hey, chief, someone's stealing your handkerchief full of crap.
Tinny Tim: Excuse me, sir? Might I have a sip of booze?
Preacherbot: I'm sorry, Tinny Tim. Seems we ran out early tonight.
Tinny Tim: I understand.
Bender: My God! That poor kid!
Fry: You're the last store open. I need something for my friend Leela. Just give me your best animal.
Salesman #2: Best? Well that's a matter of opinion. I personally like the Electric Snail.
Fry: That's a stupid animal. You're stupid! I said I want the best one. Now which costs more? The parrot or the Stink Lizard?
Salesman #2: The lizards are a buck each, the parrot is $500.
Fry: That's a hell of a good parrot. Although, I could get 500 lizards for the same price. Girls like swarms of lizards, right?
Salesman #2: Sir, the store is closing in two minutes.
Fry: Alright, I'll take the 500 lizards. No, wait, yes. No. Yes. Yes. Yes! The parrot!
Fry: Well, I spent every penny I had but I bet Leela's gonna love you. Hey, you're quite the talker, aren't you? Shut the hell up! Ow! Stupid bird! I know where you live.
Amy: Hey, it's Leela.
Leela: Sorry I stormed out before. I didn't mean to ruin everyone's Xmas.
Farnsworth: Huh? You were gone?
Leela: It's just that I get tired of Fry always only thinking of himself.
Hermes: I hear that! I aks him to set the table, instead he goes out to buy you a present. Selfish dog.
Leela: Wait! You mean he's still out? His life's in danger!
Zoidberg: Why?
Leela: I'm telling you why. Santa Claus is coming to town!
Fry: Alright, bird, you thought you could beat me in a game of wits. But you just met your equal.
Fry: Aha! Cornered!
Leela: Hi, there!
Fry: Leela! Oh, my God! You saved my life. I am gonna get you so many lizards!
Leela: You didn't need to buy me a present, Fry.
Fry: I just wanted to do something to make you happy. I mean, I miss my family but you never even had a family.
Leela: It's OK. You're lonely and I'm lonely. But, together, we're lonely together.
Fry: Merry Xmas, Leela.
Leela: Merry Xmas.
Fry: Oh, boy! It's Santa!
Santa: Ho, ho, ho! You've been very naughty, Fry and Leela. I checked my list.
Fry: Well check it twice!
Santa: I perform over 50 mega-checks per second. You're both naughty for disregarding each other's feelings.
Leela: But we set things right. Fry even risked his life to get me a present.
Santa: But what about your other co-workers? Did either of you ever stop to think about Dr. Zoidberg's feelings?
Fry: No! I swear!
Santa: Santa has something very special in his sack for you two!
Robots: So lock the door and hit the floor,
'Cause Santa Claus comes tonight.
Hattie: Go away!
Bender: Whoa, hold on! How about inviting us in for a traditional glass of hard cider?
Hattie: Oh, alright. But just one glass! OK, that's enough. I said that's enough!
Bender: Get her purse!
Fry: Please let us live! We'll put out milk and cookies for you!
Santa: You dare bribe Santa? I'm going to shove coal so far up your stocking you'll be coughing up diamonds!
Leela: We're trapped.
Fry: I never thought it would end this way: Gunned down by Santa Claus. Honestly, I didn't see it coming!
Leela: Goodbye, Fry.
Fry: Goodbye, Leela. Hey, look, we're under the mistletoe.
Santa: Your mistletoe is no match for my T.O.W. missile!
Fry: Uh, you're present may need some assembly.
Bender: On the 4th day of Xmas I stole from that lady.
Robot #1: Four family photos.
Tinny Tim: Three jars of pennies.
Robot #2: Two former husbands.
Bender: And a slipper on a shoe tree.
Raoul: Oh, thank you!
Fry: Help!
Leela: Somebody help us.
Tinny Tim: It's humans. Shall we mug them, robot sir?
Bender: No, wait, I know these guys. They got nothing.
Santa: Ho, ho, ho! You've been very naughty, Bender.
Bender: What? Me? I didn't do nothing. You're thinking of the kid.
Santa: My God, Bender! Framing an orphan? That's so naughty I'll have to add it to my list right now. Framing ... I-N-G ... ... an...
Zoidberg: Amy, this is for you. A set of combs for your beautiful hair.
Amy: Oh, that's so sweet. But I sold my hair to a wigmaker so I could buy a set of combs for Hermes.
Hermes: Oh, the irony. I sold my hair so I could buy this third set of combs for Zoidberg.
Zoidberg: Thank you. These'll come in handy for my new hair. Finally I look as pretty as I feel!
Fry: [shouting; from outside] Help!
Leela: [shouting; from outside] Help!
Bender: [shouting; from outside] Help!
Farnsworth: Oh, dear. They'll be killed on our doorstep. And there's no trash pickup until January 3rd.
Hermes: Sweet manatee of Galilee! He's on the roof!
Farnsworth: Quick! The armour-plated chimney cover! Push! Push!
Bender: Use teamwork!
Tinny Tim: Oh, dear! Oh, dear!
Santa: You've all been very naughty, very naughty indeed. Except you, Dr. Zoidberg, this is for you.
Zoidberg: A pogo-stick!
Santa: As for the rest of you, I'm going to tear off your skin like wrapping paper and deck the halls with your guts.
Bender: Yeah? Well I don't believe in Santa Claus. Come on, everybody, if you don't believe in him, he can't hurt you. Ow! God! The pain!
Santa: Ho, ho, ho! Time to get jolly on your naughty asses!
Leela: Watch out! His belly is shaking like a bowl full of nitro-glycerine!
Amy: Rudolph's nose!
Fry: He's gonna blow!
Zoidberg: Aha!
Farnsworth: Yes, good thing I got us out of that one!
Bender: Xmas dinner, everyone.
Fry: Uh, Bender? Where did you get that bird?
Bender: I found it lying in the street, like all the food I cook. Dig in, everyone.
Tinny Tim: Thank you, sir.
Bender: You got the toenail! Oh!
Fry: Look, the food isn't what's important.
Tinny Tim: I'm so hungry.
Fry: The important thing is we're all together for Xmas. And even though I'm surrounded by robots and monsters and old people, I've never felt more at home.
Farnsworth: Hear, hear! Now let's all of us shut up and sing!
Amy: He knows when you are sleeping.
Farnsworth: He knows when you're on the can.
Leela: He'll hunt you down and blast your ass from here to Pakistan.
Zoidberg: Oh.
Hermes: You'd better not breathe, You'd better not move.
Bender: You're better off dead, I'm telling you, dude.
Fry: Santa Claus is gunning you down!
Farnsworth: Merry Xmas, everyone!
Santa: I'll be back. Back when you least expect it: Next Xmas! Ho, ho, ho!
