Linda: Tonight, at 11:00.
Morbo: Doom!
Leela: Boy, that thing's big. Fry, is my colossal eye too big?
Fry: No, it's what makes you you.
Leela: But it's so round, so hideously round.
Fry: Leela, listen. You're the most beautiful woman I've ever known.
Leela: Oh. So you only care about my looks?
Fry: No, I.... What?
Linda: Finally, New New York got a blast of class today as Nikolai, playboy ruler of the Robo-Hungarian Empire, arrived aboard his extravagant, caviar-powered yacht.
Nikolai: I'm just a humble emperor, with a big, big crown!
Bender: Of course I'm not planning to steal that crown!
Leela: What?
Bender: True. I've always dreamt of being an emperor. You know, for Halloween, and then forever. But heisting those jewels would be difficult.
Leela: You'd be stupid to try.
Bender: I'll need accomplices. A sexy vamp to distract and tie up the guard.
Amy: Never!
Bender: A claw man to slip past the metal detector and cut the alarm wires.
Zoidberg: Sorry, I'm set for life after that last job. [He takes an eel out of a bucket label "Aquarium Garbage" and wraps it around himself like a cravat.]
Bender: And finally, a chump, to be caught on video and later arrested.
Fry: As I told you on Sucker-Punch Day, I'm through being a chump.
Bender: Of course, it would all require split-second robotic timing. That's were I come in. You see, I own a watch.
Farnsworth: There. This time I'm sure I've fixed the mind-switcher.
Amy: Good, I'm sick of cleaning up those heaps of dead monkeys. But why would you want your mind in a new body?
Farnsworth: Well, as a man enters his 18th decade, he thinks back on the mistakes he's made in life.
Amy: Like the heaps of dead monkeys?
Farnsworth: Science cannot move forward without heaps! No, what I regret is the youth I wasted playing it safe.
Amy: I wasted my youth porking out.
Farnsworth: Yes, I remember. [He points to a picture of a fat Amy, captioned "2997 Employee of the Year".]
Amy: Would you please take that down? It's making me hungry.
Farnsworth: Funny, I could use a little extra meat on my bones. Wait a second, if we switch bodies, I could live life to the extreme, and you could indulge your demonic food lust.
Amy: We are just the people this mind-switcher was made for by us! Wait, can I still change my mind?
Farnsworth: Let's find out.
Amy: [in Farnsworths body.] It didn't work you doddering old
Farnsworth: [in Amys body.] Ah! Cartilage! Dude, I bid you a fond cowabunga! I'm off to laugh at the Reaper. Look out, world, here I... I'm sorry, Amy, but your body is not up to the task. Also, I don't care for these boobs flapping every which way. Now quit your bologna-gargling and let's switch back to our original bodies.
Bender: Body switcher, eh? Mayhap the heist is back on. Who needs accomplices, if I can just use their bodies.
Amy: [in Farnsworths body.] Professor, what's not happening?
Farnsworth: [in Amys body.] Bad news, me. I failed to take into account the cerebral immune response.
Amy: [in Farnsworths body.] You idiot!
Farnsworth: [in Amys body.] Once two bodies have switched minds, they can never switch back. However, perhaps they can. Maybe we can swap back using a third body for temporary storage space.
Bender: I'm 60% storage space.
Farnsworth: [in Amys body.] Eh, wha?
Bender: [in Amys body.] Well, I'm off to the royal yacht for a quick seduce-and-snatch.
Amy: [in Farnsworths body.] See ya!
Farnsworth [in Benders body.]: Now then, Amy, we'll simply switch bodies, and then we'll... we'll... No, I'd be back in my body, but then you and Bender would be switched. And the Amy and Bender bodies can't trade minds again, since they just did.
Amy: [in Farnsworths body.] Oh no! Is it possible to get everyone back to normal using four or more bodies?
Farnsworth [in Benders body.]: I'm not sure. I'm afraid we need to use... MATH.
Bender: [in Amys body.] Stupid, air-needing lungs. The crown jewels. Now I just have to locate the guard and seduce him in... Four seconds?
Basil: Who goes there?
Bender: [in Amys body.] Three, two, one. Hello, big boy.
Basil: Silence! I am Basil, the emperor's cousin and chief of his royal guard. And I shall not be seduced by a...
Bender: [in Amys body.] I said, "Wow chica wow wow".
Leela: Professor, what's the matter.
Amy: [in Farnsworths body.] I'm Amy. The Professor and I switched bodies.
Leela: Oh, lord.
Amy: [in Farnsworths body.] All I wanted was to gorge myself a little, but I can't digest anything with these false teeth and this hit-or-miss colon.
Leela: At least, you get the senior discount at the movies. I hate paying $14 to see Nicolas Cage solve things.
Amy: [in Farnsworths body.] If you want to save $2, we could switch bodies.
Leela: We could always switch back, right?
Fry: Hey, Leela. Mmm. What smells saturated?
Amy: [in Leelas body.] Deep-fried ice cream sandwich wrapped in frosting and lightly baconed.
Fry: Woah. That sounds like something Amy would say and eat.
Amy: [in Leelas body.] I am Amy. Leela and I used the Professor's mind-switching machine. [She puts ketchup on her "creation".
Fry: So Leela's in your body?
Leela: [in Farnsworths body.] Not exactly. Aha! You do only like me for my body.
Fry: That is entirely not true, sir!
Bender: Now to go switch bodies with Zoidberg, sneak past the metal detector and clip the alarm wires, all in less than... Ten minutes ago! Oh! Uh, could you come back when my chump gets here?
Nikolai: Now then, what is a filthy human doing aboard my royal yacht?
Bender: [in Amys body.] With all due respect, Your Majesty, I'm a robot like you. I just switch bodies with some bimbo. Go ahead, ask me something only a robot would know.
Nikolai: Ah, a reverse Turing test, eh? Very good. What is the square root of nine?
Bender: [in Amys body.] Hold on, let me just get out a pencil. Okay, look, I'm not that kind of robot. I'm more this kind. [He starts beat boxing and Moonwalking.
Basil: He steps forwards but moves backwards.
Nikolai: By the gods! he is a machine!
Farnsworth: [in Benders body.] No, that won't restore everyone, either. Besides, I don't want my decrepit old body back! I'm running away with this invincible robot body and joining something!
Fishy Joe: I paid for 15 Robot Clowns per cubic meter of car, and you're barely giving me 12. Now crumple up and get in... And fasten your seat belts.
Robot Clown: Oh, come on!
Farnsworth: [in Benders body.] Good day. I am Nonchalanto, the robot daredevil. And my dream is to risk my life in strange and original ways.
Fishy Joe: Hmm. You don't look so foolhardy to me.
Fishy Joe: That's the dumbest thing anybody's ever done. Your hired!
Nikolai: So youre a common bending robot with a human peasant roommate?
Bender: [in Amys body.] Oh, crap, that is what I am!
Nikolai: No, Bender, I envy you. I'm so bored with all of these pretentious trappings. The jewels, the parties, the beautiful robo women.
Princess Flavia: Hello.
Nikolai: My fiance, Princess Flavia. Dearest, meet Bender. He's a robot in the body of a Chinese Martian physicist.
Flavia: How tedious.
Nikolai: Oh, to escape this gilded cage for a day.
Bender: [in Amys body.] You know, we could trade bodies. I could take over the humdrum royal stuff and you could be an regular Joe for a day. Or more. Much more.
Nikolai: In that horrible non-robot body. Sir, I have my standards.
Bender: [in Amys body.] Ah, but what if I could put you in my fabulous bending-robot body?
Nikolai: Me, posing as a lowly bending unit? How wicked! But wait, I'm supposed to give a speech at the UN tomorrow. Can I trust you to do it?
Bender: [in Amys body.] You can trust anything.
Fry; So now Leela's all crotchety because she thinks I'm not attracted to her in the Professor's body.
Hermes: You aren't, are you?
Fry: Of course not! But I was willing to lie about it. What more can a man do?
Hermes: A man can give her a toke of her own medicine.
Fry: Yes! I can put my mind in a hideous body and show Leela she's not attracted to me. But it would have to be a really, really disgusting body.
Zoidberg: Friends! Friends! I've got barnacles on my tuchus!
Hermes: The long search is over.
Bender: [in Amys body.] Wait here and earn interest while I find my robot body.
Bender: [in Amys body.] Professor?
Leela: [in Farnsworths body.] Leela. Amy?
Bender: [in Amys body.] Bender. Have you seen my body? I think the Professor's in it.
Leela: [in Farnsworths body.] Yeah, he said something about running away. Then he ran away.
Bender: [in Amys body.] What? Wither?
Bender: [in Amys body.] What am I gonna do? I got an emperor all patsied up to switch bodies, but only with another robot!
Wash bucket: Wash bucket full.
Scruffy: Scruffy's work here is done.
Bender: [in Amys body.]
Bender: [in the wash buckets body.] Now to find Emperor Von Richendoof.
Wash bucket: [in Amys body.] Now to find Scruffy.
Zoidberg: Switch bodies? I don't see why not. I also don't see why.
Fry: [in Zoidbergs body.] In your face, Leela. [He walks out, past Nikolai and Bender wash buckets body.]
Nikolai: If you're a bender, why is your body full of fetid water?
Bender: [in the wash buckets body.] If you're an emperor, why don't you shut up? Move it, Fry.
Bender: [in Nikolais body.] Well, so long.
Nikolai: [in the wash buckets body.] Wait! Point me to my normal human roommate!
Bender: [in Nikolais body.] That's him there, maybe. Got to go!
Zoidberg: [in Frys body.] Robot?
Nikolai: [in the wash buckets body.] Yes, 'tis I, Bender. Do you not recognize your own best friend?
Zoidberg: [in Frys body.] Aha! The guy in this body has a friend! Bender, old pal! It's me, the Fry!
Leela: [in Farnsworths body.] But then Nicolas Cage discovered that the real treasure was his family. Yes, I'll hold.
Fry: [in Zoidbergs body.] Hey, Leela, look! I'm in Zoidberg.
Leela: [in Farnsworths body.] Fry?
Fry: [in Zoidbergs body.] Oh, you're not so shallow that you find me repulsive because of my body, are you?
Leela: [in Farnsworths body.] Not at all. Amy, stop it! Fry, help! She's turning me into a parade float!
Fry: [in Zoidbergs body.] Eww! look at her!
Leela: [in Farnsworths body.] Oh. So you're so shallow that my body disgusts you if it puts on a little extra weight?
Fry: [in Zoidbergs body.] That wasn't a little extra weight.
Leela: [in Farnsworths body.] Admit it! You don't care about the inner me at all!
Fry: [in Zoidbergs body.] No, you admit it! You'd be ashamed to be seen in public with someone as hideous as me!
Leela: [in Farnsworths body.] Would not!
Fry: [in Zoidbergs body.] Oh, yeah? Then I challenge you to a romantic dinner at Elzar's tonight.
Leela: [in Farnsworths body.] It's on.
Hermes: Sweet orca of Majorca! You make Fat Albert look like Normal Albert!
Amy: [in Leelas body.] I don't know what to do. Do you think I should eat more butter?
Hermes: I am putting a stop to this, right now! Come on! We're switching bodies.
Amy: [in Leelas body.] Hermes, no! I'll ruin your body, too!
Hermes: Three decades of the munchies beat you to it.
Big Bertha: You make quite a show, young man. You remind me of myself as a young cannon.
Chainsaw-Eating Robot: Big Bertha is the circus's grande dame. She shoots robots through the air.
Bertha: Excuse me. Too much goulash.
Farnsworth: [in Benders body.] I've always wanted to be shot out of something. How about a quick blast after lunch.
Bertha: Alas, a fine big one like you would shatter my barrel. But, ah, to amaze the crowd once more.
Farnsworth: [in Benders body.] I understand the problem of age, but suppose I could put you into a new body?
Bertha: Never! My body may be old, but it is mine, and every crack a memory of heavy things shot a long way. Good day.
Bender: [in Nikolais body.] Ah! I have everything I every wanted. Money, wealth, riches. Yet something's missing. A hot princess with which to get grizzly.
Flavia: Hello.
Bender: [in Nikolais body.] Hello, baby! Huh? Hey, what's going on here? And why are you kissing my dashing cousin instead of me?
Flavia: Nikolai, you imperial fool! We've been having an affair for 700 years.
Basil: At long last, I shall kill you, blame the burglar and inherit the throne.
Flavia: Farewell, Nikolai.
Bender: [in Nikolais body.] Wait! I'm not Nikolai! I'm Bender, the fabulous body-switching burglar.
Basil: So you are. However, you do have Nikolai's body, and that's the part we want to kill.
Fry: [in Zoidbergs body.] Great food, huh?
Leela: [in Farnsworths body.] Ew!
Fry: [in Zoidbergs body.] I'm sorry, Leela. I hope that didn't make you ashamed to be seen with me.
Leela: [in Farnsworths body.] No, it only makes you more attractive.
Fry: [in Zoidbergs body.] Ew!
Leela: [in Farnsworths body.] Oh, did my bodily infirmity embarrass you?
Fry: [in Zoidbergs body.] Not at all. It's just another thing that makes you a very special lady.
Leela: [in Farnsworths body.] You mean, like my penis? Eh!
Fry: [in Zoidbergs body.] Admit it! You're disgusted by me!
Leela: [in Farnsworths body.] No, you're disgusted by me!
Fry: [in Zoidbergs body.] I'm as attracted to you as I've ever been!
Leela: [in Farnsworths body.] Prove it!
Zoidberg: Well, Bender, here's our apartment that we live in everyday. A floor? We live like kings?
Nikolai: [in the wash buckets body.] Kings? Silence! Like you, I'm a common lout. Now fetch me some working-class cognac from our brandy storeroom that you know how to find.
Zoidberg: Relax, Bender. I'll dry up that leak with this heating box.
Nikolai: [in the wash buckets body.] Ah, cigars. Light me up, old friend.
Robot: There you are, Emperor Nikolai. It's time for your speech to the UN.
Bender: The what now?
Scruffy: Miss Wong?
Wash bucket: [in Amys body.] No, Scruffy, I am wash bucket. I love you. Wash bucket has always loved you.
Scruffy: It's wrong, wash bucket. Oh, it would be sweet for a while, but in the back of our minds, we'd know that I'm a man and you're janitorial equipment.
Wash bucket: [in Amys body.] In another city, we could be anyone we want!
Scruffy: Go. Go now, before I beg you to stay.
Scruffy: Yep.
Nixon: Please welcome an insane dictator, and one heck of a bowler, Emperor Nikolai!
Bender: Thanks, Nixon. How we doing?
Woman: I love you, Your Majesty.
Bender: Shut up, madam ambassador, I know it. Anyhow, I'd now like to digress from my prepared remarks to say, "I'm done".
Basil: Ladies and gentlemen, this robot is an impostor! I shall enjoy this.
Bender: Not me.
Chainsaw-Eating Robot: That devil, Basil, will kill our emperor.
Farnsworth: [in Benders body.] You're Robo-Hungarian?
Robot Carny: Yes. Our nation's chief export is carnies.
Farnsworth: [in Benders body.] If only there was some way I could get to the UN to help.
Bertha: There is. Get in, Nonchalanto.
Chainsaw-Eating Robot: Bertha, no! It would kill you!
Bertha: I have not so much time left anyhow.
Farnsworth: [in Benders body.] But you could get a new body! You could have a rich, full life!
Bertha: I am trying to have a rich, full life. Long live Robo-Hungary!
Bender: Me! Thank God you've come!
Farnsworth: [in Benders body.] This is for Big Bertha. That is not what I meant to give you for Big Bertha.
Leela: [in Farnsworths body.] That was nice.
Fry: [in Zoidbergs body.] Oh, yeah.
Nixon: Ow. Ow. Arrooo!
Basil: Whoever you are, you're the bravest robot I've ever seen. I like killing brave things.
Farnsworth: [in Benders body.] Good, because I've got 20 of them per cubic meter.
Boy: When I grow up, I wanna be a diplomat!
Bender: Well, if they're is one thing I learned, it's a lesson. I believe this belongs to you.
Nikolai: [in the wash buckets body.] I shall sell it to help the common folk, now that I understand their misery.
Bender: Yeah, good luck with that.
Leela: [in Farnsworths body.] I must say, Hermes, you've got a smoking-hot body.
Hermes: [in Leelas body.] I was inspired by Amy.
Leela: [in Farnsworths body.] Wow! How did you do it.
Amy: [in Hermess body.] Well, there I was at Elzar's, eating a nice pork sundae and suddenly, I just lost my appetite. Forever.
Sweet Clyde: Q to the E to the D!
Farnsworth: [in Benders body.] So it is possible us all to get back to our original bodies?
Bubblegum: Stone-cold munching, Prof. Sweet Clyde, characterize your inversion theorem.
Sweet Clyde: Basically, no matter how permuted-up your minds are, they can be restored using, at most, two extra players.
Farnsworth: [in Benders body.] And they say pure math has no real-world applications!
Sweet Clyde: Everybody back in their zones?
Farnsworth: Ah! My body may be old, but it is mine. Brilliant work, Clyde. You'll win the NBAs highest academic honor for this.
Nikolai: Also, I'm making you a duke. So long filthy commoners.
Bender: Adis! And I'm left with the real jewels safely inside... ...his compartment!
Bender: All right. I'll need accomplices.
